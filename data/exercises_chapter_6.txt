Defibrillator machines are used to deliver an electric shock to the human heart in order to resuscitate an otherwise non-beating heart. It is estimated that a current as low as 17 mA through the heart is required to resuscitate.
Using 100,000 Ω as the overall resistance, determine the output voltage required of a defibrillating device.

A stun gun or TASER is designed to put out a few seconds worth of electric pulses that impress a voltage of about 1200 V across the human body. This results in an average current of approximately 3 mA into a human body.
Using these figures, estimate the resistance of the human body.

Having recently lost her job, Penny Penching is looking for every possible means of cutting costs. She decides that her 4.0-Watt clock radio alarm does not need to be on for 24 hours every day since she only needs it for waking up after her average 8-hour sleep. So she decides to plug it in before going to sleep and to unplug it when waking. Penny pays 12 cents per kiloWatt•hour for her electricity.
How many dollars is Penny able to save over the course of a month (31 days) with her new alarm clock usage pattern?

A 3-way light bulb for a 110-V lamp has two different filaments and three different power ratings. Turning the switch of the lamp toggles the light from OFF to low (50 W) to medium (100 W) to high (150 W) brightness. These three brightness settings are achieved by channeling current through the high resistance filament (50 W), the low resistance filament (100 W) or through both filaments.
Determine the resistance of the 50 W filaments.|Determine the resistance of the 100 W filaments.
