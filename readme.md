# IEDb

IEDb (Internet Exercise Database) is a web platform, based on Node.js, where Exercises can be stored and then be solved and rated by users of different Ability Levels.
Through this process the system produces a personalized difficulty for the users that will attempt to solve the Exercise.
The accuracy of the presiction increases as more users rate the Exercise.

For demonstration purposes a number of physics Exercises has been added to the system. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to run the system the following packeges must be installed:

* Node.js 6.11+
* MongoDB 3.4+
* Python 3.6+

### Installing
c
A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
